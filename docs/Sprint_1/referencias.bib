  abstract = {Traditional credit risk models adopt the linear correlation as a measure of dependence and assume that credit losses are normally-distributed. However some studies have shown that credit losses are seldom normal and the linear correlation does not give accurate assessment for asymmetric data. Therefore it is possible that many credit models tend to misestimate the probability of joint extreme defaults. This paper employs Copula Theory to model the dependence across default rates in a credit card portfolio of a large UK bank and to estimate the likelihood of joint high default rates. Ten copula families are used as candidates to represent the dependence structure. The empirical analysis shows that, when compared to traditional models, estimations based on asymmetric copulas usually yield results closer to the ratio of simultaneous extreme losses observed in the credit card portfolio. Copulas have been applied to evaluate the dependence among corporate debts but this research is the first paper to give evidence of the outperformance of copula estimations in portfolios of consumer loans. Moreover we test some families of copulas that are not typically considered in credit risk studies and find out that three of them are suitable for representing dependence across credit card defaults.}

  abstract = {This paper analyzes the effects of recently introduced macroprudential policies on the financial stability of the Irish economy. We use an empirical approach that is based on the statistical modeling of bivariate loan-income distributions, and find that for First Time Buyers (FTBs) borrowing limits improve financial stability risks; meaning, excessive lending has been effectively restricted. Nonetheless, preliminary evidence for Second Subsequent Buyers (SSBs) shows that financial stability actually worsens. This is because, for the sample at hand, imposing borrowing limits leads lower-income earners to increase their mortgage-borrowing. This finding challenges the one size fits all approach of Irish policy makers.}
