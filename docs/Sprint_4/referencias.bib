We characterise systemic risk by the way that financial institutions are interconnected. Using their probability of default, we classify different international financial institutions into five rating groups. Then we use the state-of-the-art canonical (C-) and D-vine copulae to investigate the partial correlation structure between the rating groups. Amongst many interesting findings, we discover that the second tier financial institutions pay a larger contribution to the systemic risk than the top tier borrowers. Further, we discuss an application of our methodology for pricing credit derivative swaps.}

  abstract = {Traditional credit risk models adopt the linear correlation as a measure of dependence and assume that credit losses are normally-distributed. However some studies have shown that credit losses are seldom normal and the linear correlation does not give accurate assessment for asymmetric data. Therefore it is possible that many credit models tend to misestimate the probability of joint extreme defaults. This paper employs Copula Theory to model the dependence across default rates in a credit card portfolio of a large UK bank and to estimate the likelihood of joint high default rates. Ten copula families are used as candidates to represent the dependence structure. The empirical analysis shows that, when compared to traditional models, estimations based on asymmetric copulas usually yield results closer to the ratio of simultaneous extreme losses observed in the credit card portfolio. Copulas have been applied to evaluate the dependence among corporate debts but this research is the first paper to give evidence of the outperformance of copula estimations in portfolios of consumer loans. Moreover we test some families of copulas that are not typically considered in credit risk studies and find out that three of them are suitable for representing dependence across credit card defaults.}

We use an empirical approach that is based on the statistical modeling of bivariate loan-income distributions, and find that for First Time Buyers (FTBs) borrowing limits improve financial stability risks; meaning, excessive lending has been effectively restricted. Nonetheless, preliminary evidence for Second Subsequent Buyers (SSBs) shows that financial stability actually worsens. This is because, for the sample at hand, imposing borrowing limits leads lower-income earners to increase their mortgage-borrowing. This finding challenges the one size fits all approach of Irish policy makers.}

  abstract={This work aims to illustrate an advanced quantitative methodology for measuring the credit risk of a loan portfolio allowing for diversification effects. Also, this methodology can allocate the credit capital coherently to each counterparty in the portfolio. The analytical approach used for estimating the portfolio credit risk is a binomial type based on a Monte Carlo Simulation. This method takes into account the default correlations among the credit counterparties in the portfolio by following a copula approach and utilizing the asset return correlations of the obligors, as estimated by rigorous statistical methods. Moreover, this model considers the recovery rates as stochastic and dependent on each other and on the time until defaults. The methodology utilized for coherently allocating credit capital in the portfolio estimates the marginal contributions of each obligor to the overall risk of the loan portfolio in terms of Expected Shortfall (ES), a risk measure more coherent and conservative than the traditional measure of Value-at-Risk (VaR). Finally, this advanced analytical structure is implemented to a hypothetical, but typical, loan portfolio of an Italian commercial bank operating across the overall national country. The national loan portfolio is composed of 17 sub-portfolios, or geographic clusters of credit exposures to 10,500 non-financial firms (or corporates) belonging to each geo-cluster or sub-portfolio. The outcomes, in terms of correlations, portfolio risk measures and capital allocations obtained from this advanced analytical framework, are compared with the results found by implementing the Internal Rating Based (IRB) approach of Basel II and III. Our chief conclusion is that the IRB model is unable to capture the real credit risk of loan portfolios because it does not take into account the actual dependence structure among the default events, and between the recovery rates and the default events. We underline that the adoption of this regulatory model can produce a dangerous underestimation of the portfolio credit risk, especially when the economic uncertainty and the volatility of the financial markets increase.},
